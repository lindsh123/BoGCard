                    <p> Lindsay is interested in increasing educational access, and has helped do so by directing HackTJ, the nation's largest high-school hackathon that is completely free, as well as hosting Techstravaganza, a free STEM fair targeted towards Title 1 schools with low funding.Through these and volunteer tutoring, she loves being able to see learners get excited about topics at all of these events.</p>
